# Title of the project:

Fetch And Render Data

# Description of the project:

This project fetches data from a public API and displays that data in a list using React. Initially, we used an API that returned a list of news articles. I improved on this by creating a website that allows the user to search for drinks and see their ingredients.

# How to Run:

- Clone this repo
- Navigate in the command line to the folder that was cloned
- Start a server using the command 'http-server -c-1'
- Open a browser and navigate to the port number given from the previous command
- Use the search bar to search for drinks

# Roadmap of future improvements:

- Add an input so that the user can see a list of drinks by ingredient
- Make each drink open a popup that lists the ingredients for that drink
